### What is Open Science EcoEvo group about

In this Groups we indetify and use a range of Open Sceince tools and practices that can improve the efficency and quality of Ecological and Evolutionary research. The core of the group is based at the Netherlands Institute of Ecology, but we welcome feiwnds and colleagues from any locality, and from other research disciplines. The goal is to create a friendly, no-pressure environment where people can share their work, ask for help on a coding problem, and learn and work together with their peers. 

### some more details

Our main vision is to:
1) Organize around several main interest areas on the interface between Open Science and EcoEvo research. These currently include (but are not limited to)
     a) Information retrieval: where to find publications, data, and code.
     b) Meta-analysis: new tools and principles
     c) Data Management and how to store your data FAIR

2) Identify the main (and easy) pathways in which our research can benefit from (but also contribute to) these areas  

3) Follow the developments in these areas, keeping an up-to date information on the infrastructures, tools, conferences, potential funding, workshops etc

4) Provide a peer to peer support in learning and implementing different tools

6) Establish collaborative projects within Nethrlands Institute of Ecology, and with other groups/institutions
7) Knowledge transfer about the benefits of Open Science and its prerequisites

Practical aspect:
1) Regular monthly meetings of the group where we will split time between updates on the developments within each area of interest (around 15 min), and on the pre-agreed session topic suggested by the group participants (these can range from discussing papers, trying out R packages, learning how to use GitHub….)
2)   Smaller sub-groups might be formed as a part of the overall group, and these can meet more often. For example, if several people would like to learn on how to use an R package, then they can split around exploring different possibilities of the package, and then reposting this to each other.

 
## How to Set Up Your Own Mozilla Study Group Website

Everything you need to set up your own beautiful Mozilla Study Group website (it looks like this!) for organizing events is [right here in the Orientation Guide.](https://mozillascience.github.io/study-group-orientation/3.3-get-online.html) If you are new to GitHub, don't worry, [there's an introduction to it here](https://mozillascience.github.io/study-group-orientation/3.1-collab-vers-github.html). Take a look, and if you need any help, you can ask a question in the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/mozillascience/studyGroup) or email sciencelab@mozillafoundation.org.

## How to Set Up Mozilla Study Group Website locally

* Fork the Repository [Mozilla Study Group.](https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroup)
* Open Terminal (on a Mac) or the equivalent on your machine and type:
	1. git clone [SSH OR HTTPS CODE FOR studyGroup]
	2. cd studyGroup/
	3. jekyll build
	4. jekyll serve
* It shows "Server address". Open it in browser. Yes, Mozilla Study Group is set locally!!
